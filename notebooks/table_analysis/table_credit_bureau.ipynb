    "I noticed that some DPD features (those ending with P) contain seemingly impossible values. The most extreme example is dpd_550P in train_credit_bureau_b_1 whose max is greater than 2e8. Assuming the unit is day, this is more than 547945 years. I haven't checked if this fact affects model performance, but probably something to keep in mind when using DPD features."
